"""Set Matrix Zeroes in place with O(1) auxiliary space.

If any cell of a matrix is zero, its entire row and column must be set to zero.
The naive fix records the zero positions in extra sets (O(m + n) space). We can
avoid that by reusing the matrix's own first row and first column as marker
storage, tracking their own fate in two booleans.

Intuition:
    A cell ``(0, j)`` or ``(i, 0)`` set to zero marks that column ``j`` or row
    ``i`` must be cleared. Scan the interior to plant these markers, then make a
    second pass to zero out interior cells whose row- or column-marker fired.
    Finally, clear the first row and/or first column if they originally
    contained a zero.

Time complexity: O(m * n).
Space complexity: O(1).
